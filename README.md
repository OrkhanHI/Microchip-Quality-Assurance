# Microchip-Quality-Assurance

Suppose you are the product manager of a microchip factory, and you are in charge of the quality assurance (QA). During QA, each microchip goes through two tests. From the two test results, you would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted, rejected or undecided (require more tests). To help you make the decision, you have a dataset of test results on past microchips, from which you can build classifiers for your future decisions. Test results from past microchips are scatter plotted as below.
